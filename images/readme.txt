PayPal allows you to use your own images at the top of the PayPal payment pages, but there are a few things to watch out for:

Header image: no larger than 750x90 pixels.
Logo image: no larger than 150x50 pixels.

Because PayPal is hosted securely, the images need to come from a secure server. If your site does not have SSL support, then you can't use these images on your PayPal pages. This prevents a browser warning from popping up.

To customize these images, we recommend creating your own images and saving them as "themes/YOURTHEME/images/paypal-header.jpg" and "themes/YOURTHEME/images/paypal-logo.jpg". You can also replace these supplied images with your own, but these changes won't be preserved at upgrade time.
